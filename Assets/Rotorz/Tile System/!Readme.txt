Extra Notes
-----------
"smooth_block" can be altered to customize the smooth platform brushes and/or
create new brushes.

"smooth_block_cull" excludes backfaces from platforms. Use this variation
when rear side of platforms is not visible to reduce number of vertices.
To use, overwrite "Rotorz/Tile System/TileBrushes/Blocks/smooth_block.fbx"
with "smooth_block_cull.fbx" (must be renamed to "smooth_block.fbx")
